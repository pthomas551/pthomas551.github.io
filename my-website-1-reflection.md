Describe what open source means.

Open source software is software where the source code is publicly shared and can be freely used and modified with various caveats depending on the license used. The most famous open source software projects (eg. Linux) are the products of global collaborations by the open source community.

What do you think about Open Source? Does it make you nervous or protective? Does it feel like utopia?

Open source software has many benefits (eg. easy collaboration, increased security) and open source licenses are the best choice in many cases. But I do not agree with some members of the open source community who say that all software should be open source. Propreitary software licenses encourage innovation by allowing companies to protect their code from competitors.

Assess the importance of using licenses.

Licenses are critical since they establish the terms on which others may use your code.

What concepts were solidified in the challenge? Did you have any "aha" moments? What did you struggle with?

It was helpful to get more practice with pushing git commits to a remote repository. I struggled a bit with remembering to create a feature branch rather than just pushing to master but that led me to reconfigure my git configuration to make the branch selection more obvious.

Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.

Existing resources were sufficient, just a matter of practice.
