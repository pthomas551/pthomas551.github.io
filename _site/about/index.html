  <h1 class="page-title">About Me</h1>
  <p>
I am a native of Ann Arbor, Michigan and now live in Chicago, Illinois after a decade studying and working in Washington, DC and a year in Singapore splitting my time between freelance consulting and traveling.
</p>

<p>My main interests lie at the intersection between globalization and transformative technology. What does this mean in practice? To quote William Gibson, I believe that the &quot;future is here...just not very evenly distributed.&quot; As technology becomes more widely distributed throughout the world, new innovations and challenges will emerge, and a new class of professionals will be required to navigate the resulting opportunities. I intend to be at the center of it.
</p>
<p>
In terms of professional experience, I worked at Georgetown University from 2005-2012 in various roles related to managing the university&#39;s global expansion. I was especially focused on developing digital marketing properties focused on major emerging economies and participating in our business development efforts in China and India. This experience culminated in earning an MBA from Georgetown in 2013, after which I moved to Singapore in 2014 to deepen my experience in one of the world&#39;s most dynamic regions.
</p>
<p>
I am currently attending <a href="http://devbootcamp.com">Dev Bootcamp</a> to refine my technical skills with the intention of finding a position in product management at a technology business in the Chicago area.
