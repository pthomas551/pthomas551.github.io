  <h1 class="page-title">About Me</h1>
  <p>I am a native of Ann Arbor, Michigan and now live in Chicago, Illinois after a decade studying and working in Washington, DC and eighteen months in Singapore splitting my time between freelance consulting and traveling.</p>

<p>My main interests lie at the intersection between globalization and transformative technology. What does this mean in practice? To quote William Gibson, I believe that the “future is here…just not very evenly distributed.” As technology becomes more widely distributed throughout the world, new innovations and challenges will emerge, and a new class of professionals will be required to navigate the resulting opportunities. I intend to be at the center of it.</p>

<p>To pursue this goal I attended, and have just graduated, <a href="http://devbootcamp.com">Dev Bootcamp</a> in Chicago. At DBC I had the opportunity to build several intersting apps including <a href="http://mic-drop.herokuapp.com" title="MicDrop">MicDrop</a>, a location-based events app that uses the React JavaScript front-end framework, and <a href="http://twitvet.herokuapp.com" title="Twitvet">TwitVet</a>, a lightweight Sinatra app that utilizes the Twitter API to vet your Twitter followers.</p>

<p>Prior to DBC I worked at Georgetown University from 2005-2012 in various roles related to global marketing and business development. I was especially focused on developing digital marketing properties focused on major emerging economies and expanding business partnerships in China and India. This experience culminated in earning an MBA from Georgetown in 2013, after which I moved to Singapore in 2014 to deepen my experience in Southeast Asia, one of the world’s most dynamic regions.</p>

<p>Teams I work well in generally include people from a wide variety of backgrounds and points of view. I find that a robust exchange of ideas and perspectives is essential to the development of a quality product. Reliance on research and data is also important to me, although sometimes educated intuition is required when data is not available. At the same time collegiality is essential - effective teams should focus on problem solving, not internal politics.</p>

<p>I am currently seeking a product management or developer position in Chicago or the Bay Area. If my background interests you I would be delighted to speak with you about how I can help you achieve your goals - please feel free to contact me on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/profile/view?id=AAMAAADlcacBSZ2VvmT57kgHuzUUj9XQFsSr8PA">LinkedIn</a> or <a href="https://twitter.com/pthomas551">Twitter</a>.</p>
