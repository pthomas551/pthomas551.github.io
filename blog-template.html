How was it to wireframe and create an HTML page with a pair?

It was fun and helpful to have someone to share ideas and resources with during the design process.

Did you find wireframing to be helpful to your development process?

Absolutlely, I think it's good to set clear design objectives before getting lost in the weeds of coding and formatting.

What did you and your pair decide made a good wireframe?

We were both fans of minimalist design that doesn't have a lot of extra elements.

What new semantic elements did you learn about (if any)?

I learned about and implemented the <header>,<nav>,<section>, and <article> tags.
