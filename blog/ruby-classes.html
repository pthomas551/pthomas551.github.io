  <h1>Classes in Ruby</h1>
  <h4>29 November 2015</h4>
    <article class="posttext">
    <p>
    In object-oriented programming, <strong>classes</strong> are essentially templates for creating new objects. They allow you to describe the basic attributes that members of a class should have, and enable you to establish modes of interaction for the class.
    </p>
    <p>
    One way in which classes are very useful is that they allow you to create easily understanable representations of real-world objects in code. Let's take the example of a car, for example. Here is how you would initialize a <em>Car</em> object in Ruby:
    </p>
    <p><code>
      class Car <br/>
        attr_reader :make <br/>
        attr_reader :model <br/>
        attr_reader :year <br/>
        def initialize(make, model, year) <br/>
          @make = make <br/>
          @model = model <br/>
          @year = year <br/>
        end <br/>
      end
    </code></p>
    <p>
    What does this code do? Basically, it sets up a template for a car that we can then reuse. Our <strong>intialize</strong> method set up the required attributes for the car - make, model, and year. Meanwhile, the <strong>attr_reader</strong> statement allows for quick and easy creation of methods for accessing these attributes of the car.
    </p>
    <p>
    What was putting @ before the variable names all about, though? We were creating <strong>instance variables</strong> for the car object. Instance variables are stored in each individual instance of the object, so you can recall them every time you recall that object. If we kept them as <strong>local</strong> variables - without the @ - we would lose their values as soon as the initialize method finished, which wouldn't be very useful! Okay, let's see how we can interact with this <em>Car</em> object in practice after entering the code above:
    </p>
    <p><code>
      irb(main):011:0> my_miata = Car.new('Mazda', 'Miata', 2009)<br/>
      => #&lt;Car:0x007fcd531123a8 @make="Mazda", @model="Miata", @year=2009&gt;
    </p></code>
    <p>
    What did this do? We created a new instance of the <em>Car</em> object and gave it a make (Mazda), model (Miata), and year (2009). Now we can use our attr_reader methods to look up these attributes of the car:
    </p>
    <p><code>
    irb(main):012:0> my_miata.make <br/>
    => "Mazda" <br/>
    irb(main):013:0> my_miata.model<br/>
    => "Miata"<br/>
    irb(main):014:0> my_miata.year<br/>
    => 2009
    </p></code>
    <p>
    This kind of basic data initialization, storage, and retrieval is just scratching the surface of what you can do with objects. You can define methods for interaction with objects - think of things like turning the car on or off, or changing some kind of control on the car. As you can see, classes are an extremely powerful feature of Ruby and many other programming languages.
