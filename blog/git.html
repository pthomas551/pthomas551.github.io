  <h1>Week 1 Technical Blog: Version Control</h1>
  <h4>21 October 2015</h4>
    <h3 class="posttext">
      Version control is a crucial technology for programmers, especially when working on collaborative projects. It allows for efficient tracking, implementation, and reverting of changes made to a codebase over time.
    </h3>
    <h3 class="posttext">
      Git is an widely used version control system and was originally created for work on the Linux kernel, one of the most famous open source projects. Git is well known for its speed and efficiency, and its features that allow for many users to collaborate on a project. One of git's most renowned features is its system for leaving messages on "commits" (code changes), which allows collaborators to explain the intention and reasoning behind their work.
    </h3>
    <h3 class="posttext">
      Many git users choose to store their projects on Github. Github is a free git repository hosting service that has many useful tools to promote collaboration between users. Because of these features Github has developed a wide following across the development community, which makes it an appealing place to communicate with colleagues and showcase work. Many well known open source software projects are hosted on Github and developers of all skill levels are active there.
